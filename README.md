# Cpp_project-
This repo contains a project about supermarket sales and contains operation from both the customers and users side as well as the administrators side, making it more convinient for the admin to manage the supermarket and customers to know about the products in the store and the thier own bill

An admin can enter the new products, make modifications in the existing products, delete records, display the records of available products in the supermarket, making it more convenient for the admin to manage the supermarket.

The customer can also quite easily place their order without any problems, can view all the products available in the supermarket, can place their order among the options available, enter the quantities and finally can also see their invoice generated for the payment to be made. The complete project proves beneficial not only for the supermarket administrator but also for the customers,making the work all the more easy and convenient.
